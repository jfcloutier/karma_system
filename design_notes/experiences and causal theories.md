# Experiences and causal theories

Connecting experiences of CAs to their causal theories:

* Other than the priori sensors and effectors, all objects are latent (abduced by a causal theory); there is no a priori 'self' (which would require 'other')
* Latent objects (with latent types and unique ids), latent property names and latent relation names, that may compose experiences, are from the signatures of current causal theories (one per CA)
* Latent observations involve latent objects and/or latent relations/properties and are always inferred from applying a causal theory to past observations
* Latent observations can not and thus need not be validated (via predictions) by umwelt CAs
* Past observations containing latent elements (latent objects, properties, relations) not underwritten by the current causal theory are ignored but not erased when predicting/perceiving current observations
* High-value, past causal theories are remembered and compete newly obtained causal theories; a previous theory can be reinstated as the current one if it is, once again, the better one
* When searching for a new causal theory, the search starts constrained to the complete signature of the current one; this constraint is relaxed as needed to find a successful causal theory
* When relaxing signature constraints, the least useful signature element is removed first
