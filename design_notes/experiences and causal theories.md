# Experiences and causal theories

A CA's observations are predictions by the CA about its umwlet CAs's experiences, perhaps value-corrected by prediction errors from the umwelt.

A CA's experiences are synthesized from the past and present observations of its umwelt CAs.

Predictions are anticipated observations as produced by a causal theory given current observations.

A causal theory may imagine/invent unobserved, i.e. **latent**, objects, properties and relations in order to make sense of actual observations.

The following describes the involvement of latent objects, properties and releations in a CA's sense making:

* Other than the priori sensors and effectors, all objects are latent (abduced by a causal theory); there is no a priori 'self' (which would require 'other')
* Latent objects (with latent types and unique ids), latent property names and latent relation names, that may compose experiences, are from the vocabularies of current causal theories (one per CA)
* Latent observations involve latent objects and/or latent relations/properties and are always inferred from applying a causal theory to past observations
* Latent observations can not and thus need not be validated (via predictions) by umwelt CAs
* Past observations containing latent elements (latent objects, properties, relations) not underwritten by the current causal theory are ignored but not erased when predicting/perceiving current observations
* High-value, past causal theories are remembered and compete newly obtained causal theories; a previous theory can be reinstated as the current one if it is, once again, the better one
* Reinstating a prior causal theory reactivates the observations/experiences that are composed of latent elements in its vocabulary (if they are absent from the current causal theory being deprecated)
* When searching for a new causal theory, the search starts constrained to the complete vocabulary of the current one; this constraint is relaxed as needed to find a successful causal theory (to prevent unnecessarily inactivating latent elements making up observations and experiences)
* When relaxing vocabulary constraints, the least used latent element is removed first
