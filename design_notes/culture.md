# Culture

The robot and its environment are both agentic systems. Each impacts the other. The robot can purposely modify its environment via niche construction (eating, seeding). The environment can affect the robot by providing or withholding food/poison and growing obstacles to its movements.

In this experiment, I have, so far, only explored the robot's point of view and how it might develop a survivable/thriving agency. The environment is a minimally modeled dynamic system: Food/poison grows apparently randomly and gets consumed by the robot's actions, the soil's fertility gets depleted or not, thickets grow in direct response the robot's behavior etc.

What if I modeled the robot's environment also as an agent intent on thriving through its own sense-making and the discovery of its affordances? What if I modeled the robot's environment as having agency?

Because of the inter-dependency between the robot and its environment, they would each need to learn about the other and find ways to communicate through their actions. They would need to develop a common culture (each would cultivate the other).

One possible outcome would see both robot and environment reaching a mutual understanding where they achieve a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship (symbiosis). Another possible outcome might have one agent finding how to take advantage of the other for its own benefit and for as long as possible (parasitism).
