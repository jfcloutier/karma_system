# Latent elements and causal theories

## Context

A CA's observations are predictions it makes about the *experiences* of its umwlet CAs. These predictions may be value-corrected by prediction errors from the umwelt. The predictions are the product of a causal theory held by the CA and induced from its prior observations. Predictions about incoming observations are produced by giving the causal theory current observations as input.

A CA synthesizes its past and present observations into experiences. An experience, for example, could be a trend detected in the observations, such as a shortening of distances observed. Each experience abstracts and is thus supported by a subset of the CA's observations.

## About latent elements

A causal theory may require more than the observations actually made by the CA to make sense of them. It may need to imagine/invent hidden and unobserved, i.e. **latent**, objects, properties and relations to formulate simple and adequate rules that model the hidden process behind the observations.

The following describes the involvement of latent elements (hidden objects, properties and relations) in the CA's sense-making processes:

* The robot's sensors and effectors are the only a priori objects making up the vocabularies of causal theories (one per CA); note that there is no a priori 'self' object (which would require 'other').
* All other objects in a causal theory are latent (they are abduced by the causal theory).
* Observations are the result of predictions produced by a causal theory; observations may contain latent elements.
* Latent observations predicted by a causal theory can not and thus need not be validated by umwelt CAs.
* A CA might adopt a new causal theory at any time; this new causal theory might have different or no latent elements.
* Past observations containing latent elements not underwritten by the current causal theory are ignored (but not erased) when predicting incoming observations or synthesizing the current set of experiences.
* Past causal theories are remembered (not indefinitely) and compete with newly obtained causal theories.
* A previous causal theory can be reinstated as the current one if it is, once again, the better one.
* Reinstating a prior causal theory reactivates the observations expressed in term of latent elements in the causal theory's vocabulary.
* When searching for a new causal theory, the search starts constrained to candidates with the same vocabulary as the current one; this constraint is relaxed as needed to find a successful causal theory (this constraint is to prevent unnecessarily inactivating latent elements making up past observations).
* When relaxing vocabulary constraints on candidate causal theories, the latent element least referenced in observations is removed first.
