# Searching for a competent collective of Cognition Actors

My rover robot will be animated by a collective of "mind processes" I call Cognition Actors. This collective starts life minimally defined and grows and shapes itself to capture what the robot learns as it strives to survive.

The collective is in effect searching for an organization of its Cognition Actors that will produce behaviors by which the robot will thrive in a dissipative environment. If we think of the organization of the collective as its "shape" then the problem is one of searching in morphospace.

The odds are very low of a random search finding a competent shape for the collective. The problem is compounded by how slow and involved the search is since it is driven by the trials and errors of an agent acting in its world and assessing the short and long term consequences of its sense making and actions.

The way I have this search set up right now is probably at best slightly better than random. I needed to do better before committing to more coding.

I have been thinking lately that optimizing the search in morphospace is not a new problem and that Nature has solved it many times. I needed to take a closer look at principles of developmental biology.

What follows is my pick of such morphogenetic principles and how they can be applied to growing a collective of Cognition Actors that is more likely to home in on a competent organization.

This is work in progress. Coding these rules and experimenting with them will reveal whether they cause a collective to converge predictably to a competent shape. Or not.

## Morphogenetic principles

* Parts from wholes, not wholes from parts: Grow from a single process via replication, division and differentiation.
* Participation sculpts cognition: Grow to an over-abundance then move to a "use it or lose it" regime.
* Stress motivates change: No or low stress means a stable shape.
* The more other parts a part integrates, the slower it changes: Higher-level abstractions are less volatile than lower-level ones.

## Morphogenesis rules

The rules are for the creation, replication, division and death of dynamic Cognition Actors.

Only dynamic Cognition Actors (dCAs) are subject to morphogenegetic processes. Static Cognition Actors are unchanging and make up the first layer of a collective. A collective of Cognition Actors grows and is shaped by its embodiment as a robot participating in the world.

* A dCA is created and added to a new layer of a collective of CAs when the previously top layer is the static layer or it has stopped dividing and is under too much stress.

* The more abstract a layer (the number of layers below it), the longer the timeframes of its dCAS and the lesser their sensitivity to stress.

* The first dCA on a new layer has the entire layer below as its umwelt (it is a "stem" dCA).

* A dCA replicates (makes an identical copy of itself), if under enough stress, until a replication limit is reached (too many "replicant" dCAs in the layer vs the size of the layer below).

* A dCA that has stopped replicating switches to division (it becomes "mitotic") unless it is already "mature" (a mature dCA has a small umwelt that can not be further divided).

* A mitotic dCA splits into 2 "daughter" dCAs if under stress. It splits at a "joint", dividing its umwelt and cognitive state where possible. Causal theories and some elements of its cognitive state may be lost because of the partition. A "joint" is a way of dividing a dCA into two that minimizes loss.

* The "daughter" dCAs born from division each replicate under stress until they reach the replication limit and become mitotic, unless they are already "mature" (they are then "end-of-line" dCAs).

* "Replicant" dCAs and "daughter" dCAs differentiate over time because of non-deterministic causal theory generation but also from non-determinism in making predictions, unifying experiences, making plans, etc.

* A dCA remembers its lineage (the sequence of replications and divisions that led to it from the "stem" dCA in its layer) even though it differentiates. This allows counting toward replication limits.

* A dCA dies if it has been a source of stress for too many consecutive timeframes.

* The death of a dCA and its removal from a layer may turn replication back on for some dCAs in that layer.
