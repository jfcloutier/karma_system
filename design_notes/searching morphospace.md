# Searching for a competent collective of Cognition Actors

My rover robot will be animated by a collective of "mind processes" I call Cognition Actors. This collective starts life minimally defined and grows to capture what the robot learns as it strives to survive. The collective grows into an abstraction hierarchy where Cognition Actors in a given layer make up the umwelt of Cognition Actors in the layer above.

The collective is in effect searching for an organization of Cognition Actors that will produce behaviors by which the robot thrives in a dissipative environment. If we think of the topology of the collective (how the Cognition Actors relate to each other) as its "shape" then the problem is one of searching in morphospace (the space of possible shapes) for a survivable one.

This space is large. The odds are very low of a random search finding a competent shape for the collective. The problem is compounded by how slow and involved the search is since it is driven by the trials and errors of the collective acting in the world and assessing the short and long term consequences of its sense making and actions.

The way I have this search set up right now is probably at best slightly better than random. I need to do better before committing to more coding.

Optimizing searches in morphospace is not a new problem. Nature has solved it many times. It's worth looking some more at developmental biology.

What follows is my pick of morphogenetic principles. They can be applied to growing a collective of Cognition Actors so it is more likely to home in on a competent organization.

This is work in progress. Coding these principles as rules and experimenting with them will reveal whether they help a collective converge to competency.

## Morphogenetic principles

* Parts from wholes, not wholes from parts: Grow from one to many via replication, division and differentiation.
* Participation sculpts cognition: Grow to an over-abundance then move to a "use it or lose it" regime.
* Stress motivates change: There is no pressure to change when stress stays low.
* The more layers a part integrates, the slower it changes: Higher-level abstractions are less volatile than lower-level ones.

## Morphogenesis rules

The collective is shaped by participating in its environment via a robot embodiment. It is composed of two kinds of Cognition Actors, static and dynamic. Only dynamic Cognition Actors in the collective are subject to morphogenetic forces. Static Cognition Actors are unchanging. They make up the first layer of a collective and mediate with the robot's sensors and motors. A collective of Cognition Actors evolves by adding and removing dynamic Cognition Actors in layers above.

A dCA experiences stress if any of its wellbeing measures (fullness, integrity and engagement) is low or is falling. Stress eventually diffuses throughout the collective.

The following rules are for the creation, replication, division and death of dynamic Cognition Actors (dCAs).

* A dCA is created and added to a new layer of a collective of CAs when the previously top layer is the static layer or it has stopped dividing and is under too much stress.

* The more abstract a layer (the number of layers below it), the longer the timeframes of its dCAS and the lesser their sensitivity to stress.

* The first dCA on a new layer has the entire layer below as its umwelt (it is a "stem" dCA).

* A dCA replicates (makes an identical copy of itself), if under enough stress, until a replication limit is reached (too many "replicant" dCAs in the layer vs the size of the layer below).

* A dCA that has stopped replicating switches to division (it becomes "mitotic") unless it is already "mature" (a mature dCA has a small umwelt that can not be further divided).

* A mitotic dCA splits into 2 "daughter" dCAs if under stress. It splits at a "joint", dividing its umwelt and cognitive state where possible. Causal theories and some elements of its cognitive state may be lost because of the partition. A "joint" is a way of dividing a dCA into two that minimizes loss.

* The "daughter" dCAs born from division each replicate under stress until they reach the replication limit and become mitotic, unless they are already "mature" (they are then "end-of-line" dCAs).

* "Replicant" dCAs and "daughter" dCAs differentiate over time because of non-deterministic causal theory generation but also from non-determinism in making predictions, unifying experiences, making plans, etc.

* A dCA remembers its lineage (the sequence of replications and divisions that led to it from the "stem" dCA in its layer) even though it differentiates. This allows counting toward replication limits.

* A dCA dies if it has been a source of stress for too many consecutive timeframes.

* The death of a dCA and its removal from a layer may turn replication back on for some dCAs in that layer (if they fall below their replication limit).
