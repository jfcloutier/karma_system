# Ontology

The working ontology of the Karma project is processual/relational in kind and deflationary in intent. It allows for basal (minimalist) agency in both living and artificial systems.

I take it as self-evident that a mortal agent must be sentient (aware) to adapt and survive. I suspect that this alone is not sufficient and that some degree of consciousness (being aware of being aware) is additionally required for any living being, however simple, to survive. It remains to be seen -but would not be all that surprising- if this were also the case for *artificial* mortal agents.

## Being

> A metastable system of processes achieving [constraint closure](https://montevil.org/publications/articles/2015-mm-organisation-closure-constraints/)

A *living* being is additionally self-producing

## Umwelt (the being's)

> All that is not the **being** and can change the being or be changed by it

The being's meaningful outer-world

## Innenwelt

> Changes to the **being** that are available to its **sentience**

The being's meaningful inner-world

## Sentience

> Processes of **being** instantiating the **feelings**, **experiences**, **beliefs** and **actions** of the being

## Action

> Changes to and by the **being** that cause changes to the being's **umwelt** or changes the being's relations to it

## Feelings

> Changes to the **innenwelt** that stand for measuring the being's precariousness 

Feelings of low precariousness are good feelings

## Experiences

> Durable changes to the **innenwelt** from unifying in space-time prior changes, and associating them with **feelings**

## Beliefs

> Durable changes to the **innenwelt** that stand for detecting regularities, or the loss thereof, in **experiences**

## Consciousness

> **Experiences** of **sentience**

A being is minimally conscious the moment it experiences any one aspect of its sentience

## Agent

> A **sentient** **being**, possibly **conscious**, who **acts** in accordance to its **beliefs** to have **experiences** that **feel** good
