# Ontology

The working ontology of the Karma project is processual/relational in kind and deflationary in intent. It allows for basal (minimalist) agency in both living and artificial systems.

I take it as self-evident that a mortal agent must have some awareness of itself and its world to adapt and survive. I suspect that some awareness *of being aware* is also required for the survival of even the simplest living being, or the survival of a mortal robot.

## Being

> A metastable system of processes achieving [constraint closure](https://montevil.org/publications/articles/2015-mm-organisation-closure-constraints/)

A *living* being is additionally self-producing

## Umwelt (the being's)

> All that is not the **being** and can change the being or be changed by it

The being's meaningful outer-world

## Innenwelt

> Changes to the **being** that are available to its **sentience**

The being's meaningful inner-world

## Sentience

> Processes of **being** instantiating the **feelings**, **experiences**, **experiences** and **actions** of the being

## Action

> Changes to and by the **being** that cause changes to the being's **umwelt** or changes the being's relations to it

## Feelings

> Changes to the **innenwelt** that stand for measuring the being's precariousness

Feelings of low precariousness are good feelings

## Experiences

> Durable changes to the **innenwelt** from unifying in space-time prior changes, and associating them with **feelings**

## Experiences

> Durable changes to the **innenwelt** that stand for detecting regularities, or the loss thereof, in **experiences**

## Consciousness

> **Experiences** of **sentience**

A being is minimally conscious the moment it experiences any one aspect of its sentience

## Agent

> A **sentient** **being**, possibly **conscious**, who **acts** in accordance to its **experiences** to have **experiences** that **feel** good
