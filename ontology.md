# Ontology

The working ontology of the Karma project. It is processual in kind and deflationary in intent.

## Being

> A metastable system of processes achieving [constraint closure](https://montevil.org/publications/articles/2015-mm-organisation-closure-constraints/). A *living* being is additionally self-producing.

## Umwelt (the being's)

> All that is not the **being**, and can change the being or be changed by it (the being's meaningful outer-world)

## Innenwelt

> Changes to the **being** available to its **sentience** (the being's meaningful inner-world)

## Sentience

> Processes of **being** that integrate *durable changes* to the **innenwelt**, causing further changes to the being's innenwelt or instantiating **actions**

## Action

> Concerted changes to the **being** that cause changes to the being's outer world or to the being's relatedness to it

## Feelings

> Durable changes to the **innenwelt** (such changes are always caused by the **being**'s processes) that stand for measures of the being's precariousness. Feelings of low precariousness are good feelings.

## Experiences

> Durable changes to the **innenwelt** that stand for prior changes to the innenwelt associated with extent **feelings**

## Beliefs

> Durable changes to the **innenwelt** that stand for regularities, or loss thereof, in **experiences**

## Consciousness

> **Experiences** of **sentience**

## Agent

> A **sentient** **being**, possibly **conscious**, who changes itself and acts in accordance to its **beliefs**, promoting experiences that feel good
