# Ontology

The working ontology of the Karma project. It is processual in kind and deflationary in intent. It allows for basal (minimalist) agency and consciousness in both living and artificial systems.

One can argue that some degree of consciousness, conceived of as second-order sentience, is required for any living being, however elementary, to survive. It remains to be seen (but would not be all that surprising) if this is also the case for mortal, artificial agents.

## Being

> A metastable system of processes achieving [constraint closure](https://montevil.org/publications/articles/2015-mm-organisation-closure-constraints/). A *living* being is additionally self-producing.

## Umwelt (the being's)

> All that is not the **being**, and can change the being or be changed by it (the being's meaningful outer-world)

## Innenwelt

> Changes to the **being** that are available to its **sentience** (the being's meaningful inner-world)

## Sentience

> Processes of **being** that instantiate the **feelings**, **experiences**, **beliefs** and **actions** of the being

## Action

> Changes to and by the **being** that cause changes to the being's outer world or to the being's relatedness to it

## Feelings

> Changes to the **innenwelt** that stand for measures of the being's precariousness. Feelings of low precariousness are good feelings.

## Experiences

> Durable changes to the **innenwelt** from integrating prior changes to it and associating them with **feelings**

## Beliefs

> Durable changes to the **innenwelt** that stand for regularities, or loss thereof, in **experiences**

## Consciousness

> **Experiences** of **sentience** (a being enters the consciousness spectrum as soon as it can experience the tiniest fraction of its sentience)

## Agent

> A **sentient** **being**, possibly **conscious**, who acts in accordance to its **beliefs**, promoting experiences that feel good
