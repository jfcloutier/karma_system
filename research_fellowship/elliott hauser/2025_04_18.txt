Three + 1 levels:
- Operational (causal - consequential/insensate)
- Cognitive (generative - probabilistic/sensate)
- Metacognitive (effective - embodied/effectively counterfactual) <= when does this emerge
- External observation (researchers, who have generative models we believe to be causally accurate)

Policies are operational: they are configuration of insensate dynamics
Policies "surface" affordances that are sensate

Selecting/pursuing a generated affordance should operationally reinforce it - at the insensate level => Pavlovian/Levin type basal cognition
Chemotaxis reinforces chemotaxis

Operationalize metric parameters:
- Integrity: high amplitude all-or-nothing stress dumps
- Fullness: unconscious/indirectly sensed

(High-level CA acting as wellbeing capacitors)

Characteristic dynamics:
- Directive: high amplitude all-or-noting wellbeing dumps
- Integrative: high capacitance for stress and even fullness output
- 'Greedy': high capacitance for 'fullness' and even stress output
Operationalize metric parameters:
- Fragility: high amplitude all-or-nothing stress dumps
- Fullness: unconscious/indirectly sensed

Characteristic dynamics:
- Directive: high amplitude all-or-noting wellbeing dumps
- Integrative: high capacitance for stress and even fullness output
- 'Greedy': high capacitance for 'fullness' and even stress output


^ All of these are cognitively minimal

Capacitor would be operationalized by capacity, threshold of activation, and amplitude/magnitude of activation.

=> Policies are operational and should never be _directly_ transmitted

Metacognitive: taxis <= affordance surfaced by generative model that broadcasts resource
Cognitive level: resource received <= simplistic dynamics
