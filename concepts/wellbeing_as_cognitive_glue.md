# How wellbeing propagates in a collective of cognition actors

In my design, a robot's agency is implemented by a dynamic collective of cognition actors (CAs). CAs form an evolving abstraction hierarchy where each CA has an umwelt composed of a few lower-level CAs it observes. The lowest-level CAs observe the physical sensors of the robot.

Central to my design is the concept of wellbeing as carrier of normativity. Fullness, integrity and engagement are a CA's three measures of wellbeing.

The wellbeing of each CA fluctuates over its lifetime, with low or dropping wellbeing signalling risk to survival and creating stress. Stress affects the behavior of a CA, causing it to take actions to terminate beliefs it associates with "bad feelings". Stress also makes a CA more "plastic", such as lowering the thresholds for the CA to try new policies or prompting it to revise the current causal theory by which it makes sense of its umwelt.

Wellbeing, positive or negative, is contagious; it spreads from CA to CA up and down umwelt relationships. This diffusion of wellbeing signals is key to multiple CAs behaving as a collective. If, for example, a CA's feeling of integrity lowers dramatically from directly observing repeated collisions, the stress it feels needs to be shared with other CAs if they are to get involved in preventing further collisions. Stress acts as a cognitive glue for the collective.

A CA can decide to act as a "wellbeing capacitor" by "hoarding" wellbeing signals it receives from its umwelt CAs and releasing them back later on. Alternatively, a CA might decline wellbeing signals from its umwelt, letting them temporarily accumulate  in it. Such internal actions allow a CA to manipulate the "mood" of its umwelt CAs and alter their usual priorities. For example, a CA way up in the hierarchy might decide to have the CAs underneath it tolerate more pain while the collective is urgently seeking food; it would do so by declining integrity signals and letting them accumulate in its umwelt. Or it might decide to make them more responsive to hunger, by hoarding fullness signals and draining them from its umwelt.

I updated my design notes on wellbeing in a collective of cognition actors.

My thanks to @Elliott Hauser  for bringing cool ideas to this project such as the notions of stress, wellbeing diffusion and wellbeing capacitance.
