# The environment as agent

The robot and its environment impact each other. The robot can purposely modify its environment by moving, eating and seeding (niche construction). The environment can affect the robot by providing or withholding food/poison and growing obstacles to its movements.

In this experiment, I have so far only explored the robot's point of view and how it might develop a survivable/thriving agency. The environment is a minimally modeled dynamic system: Food/poison grows apparently randomly and gets consumed by the robot's actions, the soil's fertility gets depleted or not, thickets grow in direct response the robot's behavior etc.

What if I also modeled the robot's environment as an entity intent on thriving through its own sense-making, belief formation and the discovery of its affordances? What if I modeled the robot's environment as having agency?

Because of the inter-dependency between the robot and its environment, they would each need to learn about the other and find ways to communicate through their actions. They would perhaps learn a set of mutually understood action-signs and thus build what might be called a [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics_of_culture) where, after all, each one attempts to cultivate the other.

One possible outcome would see both robot and environment reaching an understanding whereby they achieve a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship (symbiosis). Another possible outcome might have one agent learning how to manipulate the other to maximize its own wellbeing for as long as possible (parasitism).

I don't intend to pursue these ideas at the moment. I have more than enough on my plate as it is. But eventually I just might.
